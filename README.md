Airbnb for Study Spaces

Every year around test season, which is all the time at Berkeley, libraries become jam packed and study spaces are hard to come by. That's why we built a platform for people to rent out their spaces to fellow students through the day. Similar to AirBnb, the places would be organized based on the style of location, amenities, reviews, and distance so that you can find the optimal study space for you.
